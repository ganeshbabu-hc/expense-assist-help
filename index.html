   <h1>Help section</h1>
    1. Help customers find the page
    Most of the SaaS companies I reviewed include customer support (help & knowledge base) options on their contact page
    and link to the contact page in the header or footer. There is a fairly even split amongst the 13 applications, half
    in the header and half in the footer (with a couple opting for both locations). Which should you use? The header is
    often more visually prominent, but usability studies show that fat footer link blocks are easily found (and used)
    too.
    Use common language

    Though contact page names varied between companies, these are the 3 most widely used terms:
    “Support”

    HubSpot
    Basecamp
    Zapier
    “Help”

    WordPress.com
    Help Scout
    “Contact Us”

    Slack
    Campaign Monitor
    Hootsuite
    Squarespace covers all the bases, using “Contact Us” and “Help & Support.” Mixpanel directly links their support
    page, but they use “Documentation” as a navigation link.
    Freshbooks and Salesforce both show a phone number prominently in the header navigation and make it a clickable link
    to their contact options. It is clear they are driving phone support as the primary choice (a design decision I’ll
    cover later in this list).
    Any of these terms will be recognizable to your customers, as long as you make them easy to locate and you pick a
    phrase that is not too similar to other links in your navigation. For example, using both “contact” and “help” for
    different pages adds another decision point that can frustrate someone who needs to talk to support.
    Takeaway: Don’t make people hunt for your contact page — stick with a standard location.
    2. Humanize your customer service team
    Customers who are looking for help are often stressed and frustrated, and when they can only communicate with you
    through text chats or emails. It’s easy for them to feel unimportant or ignored. In my career, I’ve heard versions
    of “I want to talk to a real person, not a robot!” from customers many times.
    Research shows that our brains are finely tuned to recognize faces, and having other people around tends to create
    more cooperative behaviours (even just a poster of a face has that effect).
    Help Scout help page

    Campaign Monitor help page

    Help Scout, Campaign Monitor, and Zapier all feature photos of their real support agents on their contact pages.
    Basecamp uses fun illustrated portraits. Showing that there are real humans on the other side of the page is a
    simple way to make your customers feel more confident that they will be helped, which in turn may make them more
    likely to be relaxed and polite in their interactions.
    Takeaway: Use faces on your contact page to improve customer interactions.
